For final, I completed 3 main tasks as follows:


1)	Consider the following blood pressure dataset (IC_BP_v2.csv). Perform the following operations
a.	Convert BP alerts to BP status
b.	Define Hypotension-1 & Normal as Controlled blood pressure Hypotension-2, Hypertension-1, Hypertension-2 & Hypertension-3 as Uncontrolled blood pressure: Controlled & Uncontrolled blood pressure as 1 or 0 (Dichotomous Outcomes) 
c.	Merge this table with demographics (SQL table) to obtain their enrollment dates
d.	Create a 12-week interval of averaged scores of each customer 
e.	Compare the scores from baseline (first week) to follow-up scores (12 weeks)
f.	How many customers were brought from uncontrolled regime to controlled regime after 12 weeks of intervention?


2)	Merge the tables Demographics, Conditions and TextMessages. 
Obtain the final dataset such that we have 1 Row per ID by choosing on the latest date when the text was sent (if sent on multiple days)

3)	Repeat Question 2 in R. 
Hint: You might want to use tidyr/dplyr packages

For Q3, I also provided R codes.
