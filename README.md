For midterm, I firstly found some problems to clean the dataset and I listed all of them to make the table more clear. Then I used ODBC library in R t connect the dataset in the sql database. I then continue used sqlquery to operate the data in th dataset in sql. For each question, I explained that the reasons why I made this change and how I made this change. I also provide sql codes for reference.
